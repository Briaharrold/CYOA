      It was dark morning, you managed to sneak out of your house with your<br>
      bike. To later, meet up with your group of friends at Timothy's house his<br>
      house was the closes to the abandoned water park we all wanted to go to.<br>
      After doing some research. You guys found about this abandoned waterpark<br>
      that has recently closed, it was called the Schlitterbahn Kansas City<br>
      water park. Why would we want to go there you may ask? Because the<br>
      Verrückt which means "insane" in German it was considered the world's<br>
      largest water slide in 2016. We thought it would be a cool place to shoot<br>
      a youtube video.

      Once everyone got to Timothy's house we all headed to the park. Okay we've<br>
      arrived, now we've entered through the front door we can see through the<br>
      distace a wave pool and the Verrückt.
