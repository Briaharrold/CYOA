      bike. To later, meet up with your group of friends at Timothy's house his
      house was the closes to the abandoned water park we all wanted to go to.
      After doing some research. You guys found about this abandoned waterpark
      that has recently closed, it was called the Schlitterbahn Kansas City
      water park. Why would we want to go there you may ask? Because the
      Verrückt which means "insane" in German it was considered the world's
      largest water slide in 2016. We thought it would be a cool place to shoot
      a youtube video.

      arrived, now we've entered through the front door we can see through the
