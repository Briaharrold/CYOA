      It was dark morning you managed to sneak out of your house with your bike. <br>
      Later, to meet up with your group of friends at Timothy's house his <br>
house was close to the abandoned water park we all wanted to go to. <br>
After doing some research. You guys found out about this abandoned waterpark, <br>
which has recently closed the waterpark, was called the Schlitterbahn Kansas City <br>
waterpark. Why would we want to go there, you may ask? Because the <br>
Verr端ckt means "insane" in German was considered the world's <br>
largest water slide in 2016. We thought it would be a cool place to shoot <br>
a YouTube video there.Once everyone got to Timothy's home we all headed  <br>
to the park. Okay we've arrived, we hopped the fence and passed the first gate  <br>
we can see the Verr端ckt standing at a height of 168 feet 7 and inches. <br>

      Once everyone got to Timothy's house we all headed to the park. Okay we've<br>
      arrived, now we've entered through the front door we can see through the<br>
      distace a wave pool and the Verr端ckt.
