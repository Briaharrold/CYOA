      After I talked to my friends about going back home inteaded of going down
      the slide as I thought it was too dangerous. We came to an agreement and
      went back home. I persued them by telling them my mom had just baked some
      cookies and that they would get some when we go back. Must have been nuts
      to come this far for a youtube video but I'm glad I got some cookies now.
